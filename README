            Dump a PostgreSQL database in a nice way.


~ What is pgmboi?

This is a small CLI application, that dumps all named schemas, functions
and tables, in separate folders and SQL files.

It generates a folder for each schema and then dumps all tables and
functions inside it.

Finally you can restore from the generated SQL files the entire structure
to a selected database.


~ What is the purpose of this?

Well, I started this project with the objective of facilitating the
versioning of a database SQL code in git. Trying to emulate packages
or modules like Python, breaking the schemas in separate 
folders (packages) and each table in individual file (modules).

So, when you change something in a table, function or schema in your
database, you will commit changes on a more simplified and organized
file, instead of a single big file, like the one pg_dump generates.


~ Is this ready?
A BIG NO. I can't even say that this application are in alpha.

I am a beginner developer and this is my first open source project 
and with it I am introducing myself to Python, unit testing and more 
concept about PostgreSQL.

So, I will appreciate any advice about how to make better test and code. :)
